			<p><i>Magical Firearm (Light Machine-Gun), unique</i></p>
			
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Properties. </i></b>Chainsaw Bayonet, Two-Handed, Reload (8), ROF (2), Ammunition (range 450/800).</p> 
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Damage. </i></b>1d6 (Ammunition).</p> 
			
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Magical Weapon. </i></b>This weapon ignores resistances to nonmagical damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Scorching Chainsaw Bayonet. </i></b>As a bonus action you can make a scorching chainsaw bayonet magically appear on the tip of your rifle. This allows the weapon to be used as a simple melee weapon. On a successful hit it deals 1d6 fire damage and your next ranged attack with this weapon on the same target does not suffer disadvantage from close combat until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Two-Handed. </i></b>This weapon requires two hands to use.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Reload (x). </i></b>This weapon must be reloaded after it has made a number of shots or strikes equal to the value shown in the brackets (x). It takes an action to reload.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>ROF (x). </i></b>Some weapons make more than one shot or strike per attack. The number of shots or strikes a ranged weapon makes each time it is activated is shown in the brackets (x).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ammunition. </i></b>Unlike conventional ammunition, all firearm ammunition is purchased in magazines, or clips, instead of individual rounds. A weapon’s magazine lasts for as long as the Reload (x) property listed on its profile, regardless of the amount of shots the weapon might actually fire. A weapon with no damage type uses the damage type of it’s ammunition.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentience. </i></b><i>Shiela</i> is a sentient true neutral weapon with hearing and vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon can speak, read and understand Common and Undercommon.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Damage. </i></b>2d6 (Ammunition).</p> 
			
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Magical Weapon. </i></b>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Poison Coating. </i></b>You can use a bonus action to cause thick, black poison to coat the next bullet - changing its damage type to poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until this weapon fires a shot (regardless of hit or miss). On a successful hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 additional poison damage and become poisoned until the end of your next turn. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Railgun. </i></b>The range of this weapon is increased by 100ft (to 600/1300).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Heavy. </i></b>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Two-Handed. </i></b>This weapon requires two hands to use.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Reload (x). </i></b>This weapon must be reloaded after it has made a number of shots or strikes equal to the value shown in the brackets (x). It takes an action to reload.</p>

	<element name="Arrow of Wrangling" type="Item" source="Qadrudia Campaign Custom" id="ID_QAD_CAMPAIGN_ITEM_GRAPPLE_ARROW">
		<description>
			<p>An arrow made of metal, decorated with hooks that extend when pulled in the opposite direction.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hooked Arrowhead. </i></b>When you hit a successful attack using this arrow, it lodges into your target and grabs into it with metal hooks dealing an extra 1d4 damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ropeshot. </i></b>You can attach up to 90 ft of rope to this arrow without affecting the shot. If you successfully attack a small, medium, large or huge creature with this arrow, it can move unimpeded within a circle centered on the creature holding the other end of the rope. The radius of this circle is determined by when the ropeholder decides to tension the rope.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Struggle. </i></b>Should the hooked creature try to move outside this radius, then it must make a Strength (Athletics) check against the ropeholder’s Strength (Athletics). On a failure it looses half its movement. On a success it can move at half speed and drag the ropeholder along (forced movement), or it moves unimpeded if the ropeholder chooses to let go of the rope.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Wrangle. </i></b>Conversely, the ropeholding creature can spend an action to reduce the radius by pulling in rope. If the rope is slack or the ropeholder chooses to move towards the hooked creature, the ropeholder can pull in up to 30 ft of rope. Additionally, if the rope is taut, the ropeholder can make a Strength (Athletics) check against the hooked creature’s Strength (Athletics) in order to forcefully move it closer. On a success the hooked creature is moved towards the ropeholder by 5 ft if its size is greater than the ropeholder’s, or 10 ft otherwise.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can choose to climb the rope. Whether or not the arrow holds your weight, the Strength (Athletics) DC for the climb and any (dis)advantage are at the DM’s discretion.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature of reasonable intelligence might realize eventually, that it can just try to cut the rope.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away.</p>
			<p class="indent">When this grenade lands, it emits a cloud of gas that creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot sphere. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 2 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round. Otherwise, the gas lasts for 3 rounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">All creatures who end their turn within the cloud must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>
