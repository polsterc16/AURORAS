		<description>
			<p>Basically a wet piece of cloth that you wear over the mouth and nose. If you breathe through it, exposure to mustard gas has no effect on you for 2 rounds before the mask becomes ineffective.</p>

	<element name="Gas Mask" type="Item" source="Qadrudia Campaign Custom" id="ID_QAD_CAMPAIGN_ITEM_GAS_MASK">
		<description>
			<p>A Gas Mask is a sealed mask which protects its wearer from inhaling hazardous gasses, vapors, fumes, and particles (including radioactive particles).</p>
			<p>While wearing this mask, you are immune to non-magical inhaled chemicals, toxins, or particles, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical inhaled chemicals, toxins, or particles.</p>
			<p>Its filters need to be replaced after one hour of use. It takes one action to replace a filter, due to the masks design to be used in emergency situations.</p>
			<p><i>"For those moments when it is not love that is in the air."</i></p>

	<element name="Parachute" type="Item" source="Qadrudia Campaign Custom" id="ID_QAD_CAMPAIGN_ITEM_PARACHUTE">
		<description>
			<p>When equipped (as you would a normal backpack), as a bonus action while falling, you can pull a chord on this packpack to release its parachute.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your descend is slowed to 60 feet per round, and if the parachute is not damaged before you land, you take no falling damage. You have advantage on any Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make to land on your feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, the parachute does not disappear, and your movement speed is halved while it is loose on the ground.</p>
			<p class="indent">The parachute has an AC of 11 and 15 HP. Its approximate dimensions are 15 by 15 by 10 feet while in the air.</p>
			<p><i>"If you are prone to jumping into dangerous situations head first, you might as well take this with you."</i></p>
