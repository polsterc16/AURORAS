            <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
            <p>Serpentfolk combine a humanlike upper body with the lower body of a snake. The colours of their scales vary wildly but often show beautiful patterns as those seen on real snakes. Their upper bodies sometimes display additional reptilian traits such as fangs, slit eyes and patches of scales.</p>
			
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>The serpentfolk are an ancient race, predating humans, but never spread as far as them, partially due to them preferring a warmer climate. They tend to be traditional and set in their ways, leading to their numbers slowly dwindling over the ages. There now remain a few serpentfolk civilizations, usually secluded from the outside world, living either in the wild or in the remains of ancient cities from their days of glory.</p>
			
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Serpentfolk society is structured and traditional. They have a caste system and a strict hierarchy, choosing their leaders by rituals of divination. They tend to keep to themselves for the most part and try to live their lives as they did in ancient times. Not all serpentfolk agree with these ideals though and there are some who venture outside of their familiar realms to explore the world and mingle with the other races, sometimes becoming adventurers.</p>

			<h4>SERPENTFOLK NAMES</h4>
			<p>Serpentfolk tend to have names stemming from ancient egyptian, mayan or aztec culture, usually with a meaning. Male and female names are often interchangable.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Male.</span>Tlaloc (“earth”), Etzli (“blood”), Mahuizoh (“glory”)<br />
			<span class="feature">Female.</span>Itzel (“rainbow”), Milintica (“fire”), Yolotli (“heart”)<br />
			</p>
