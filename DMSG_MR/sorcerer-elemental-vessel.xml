			<p>Your innate magic comes from a connection to one of the elemental planes: Fire, Water, Earth or Air. </p>
			<p class="indent">This can have different reasons such as being born during an epic storm, surviving a roaring fire, being lost at sea for a long time or buried alive. Some say there was a spark inside you from birth that only needs to be awakened, others say that overexposure to your element has gifted you with your abilities to better cope with it. You or your ancestors could have also been directly touched by the magic of a powerful elemental or powerful magic in general. </p>
			<p class="indent">Whatever the reason, your soul is tied firmly to an elemental plane and you can wield the associated powers to destroy your enemies.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to turn your body into that of an elemental of your elemental focus (<i>Fire Elemental</i> for fire etc.). You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can stay in your elemental shape for an hour. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points or die.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the elemental, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the elemental. If the elemental has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the elemental's bonus instead of yours.</li>
				<li>When you transform, you assume the elemental's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.</li>
				<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
				<li>Your worn equipment merges with the new form for the duration of the transformation.</li>
				<li>You can cast spells in your elemental form.</li>
