			<p><center>—Leonardo da Vinci</center></p>
			
            <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
            <p>Catfolk vary greatly in their appearance, being anthropomorpic felines with tails, claws and fur covering their entire body. Their fur colour and body shape reflects that of actual wild cats, with great variance among them.</p>
			
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Catfolk descended from felines thousands of years ago, only just older than humans. Catfolk are a tribal people, whose passion and love run deep. They form tribes around the world, often in harsh climates ranging from deep in the rain forests, to scorching savannahs, all the way to freezing arctic regions, but are also common around forest edges. Like elves, catfolk are attuned to nature, respect it and defend it against those who would do it harm.</p>
			
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Catfolk societies vary greatly, from those living a nomadic lifestyle, to highly territorial tribes. The tribes stay small though and split up when they become too big. They are naturally curious and many catfolk leave their tribes behind and seek out lives as adventurers. Quite a few also abandon life in the wilds to live with more civilized races in cities and villages. </p>

            <h4>CATFOLK TRAITS</h4>
